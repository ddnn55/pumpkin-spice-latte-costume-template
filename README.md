Tools for creating a Pumpkin Spice Latte mask

## Usage

1. Project [template image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/186277/32137975-7424f65a-bbf8-11e7-9f93-b1b661761fb2.png) onto sturdy, cut/slice-able material like foam core.

2. Trace outlines in the projection with a pencil, onto the base material

3. Use heavy duty green and brown markers to fill in the green and brown areas.

4. Cut around the outline of the cup and whipped cream.

5. Cut a hole for the face of human wearing the mask (the inner ellipse implied in the Starbucks logo is a good trade-off, but if you really want accuracy, you can cut out just the face of the Starbucks character, but then you will have a massive mask if done to scale.)

6. Attach mask to a hat. I will fasten it to the clasp of a baseball cap warn backwad.

(Also optionally use real pumpkin spice and/or whipped cream somehow. Or cinammon or dirt for believable pumpkin spice.)
